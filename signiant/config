# Config for the artifact destoyer
# Seperate values with commas. It's pretty rudimentary, so don't expect miracles
#
# ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES = Required environment variables to determine artifact paths. If any of these don't exist the job will be skipped over.
# DEPLOYMENT_PATHS = The paths that a build MAY be deployed to. It will have a regex expression that will try to replace any string with $ infront of it with an environment variable value.
# DEPLOYMENT_STRUCUTURES = The build folder string
# IGNORE_JOBS = Job names included in here will be skipped (CURRENTLY NOT IMPLEMENTED)
# SPLIT_TOKEN = The token which to split a deployment path on. It should be something common
